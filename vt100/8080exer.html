		<h1>8080/8085 CPU Exerciser</h1>
		<hr>

		<div id="content">
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>In the early 1990s Frank Cringle wrote an exerciser for the Z80 
and released it under the GNU General Public License.  The purpose of 
the exerciser was to test the operations of Z80 emulators against the 
results obtained from a physical Z80 CPU, and to document the results.</p>
			<p>I was in need of a way to test my 8080 emulator, so I have 
modified Frank's work to provide a similar facility for the 8080 CPU.  
Details of the changes I made, and Frank's original documentation, can 
be found in the source file (link below).</p>
			<p>The exerciser doesn't work in the way you would probably expect: 
perform a single CPU instruction and immediately check the resulting 
processor state.  Instead it programatically selects, and executes with 
varying arguments, a series of associated opcodes (all 8 bit ALU 
operations for example) and after each operation it merges the new CPU 
state (registers and flag values) into a running CRC value.</p>
			<p>After each individual group of tests you therefore end up with a 
single CRC value that represents the amalgamated results of every 
operation that was executed as part of that test.  If you run the same 
test on a physical CPU as well as an emulator, and the generated CRC 
value from each source is identical, then you can safely assume that the
 emulator is working in exactly the same way as the hardware.</p>
			<p>There are two downsides to this technique -</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You only get a Pass/Fail response. There is no indication as to which operation failed.</li>
				<li>You have to have access to the results of the same tests run on a physical CPU, to obtain the baseline results.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There's nothing much I can do about the first downside, that's up 
to the emulator writer and a lot of tea (or coffee).  The second 
downside is what this page hopes to address.</p>

			<h2>Basic Exerciser</h2>
			<p>The basic exerciser has no pre-defined CRC result values.  For 
each test it expects a 32-bit CRC of 0 and, as a different result will 
always be obtained, it reports the test as failing.   However, the error
 message also includes the expected CRC, and that is what we are 
interested in here.</p>
			<img src="8080exer_files/8080exer.png" alt="Basic exerciser">
			<p>I would appreciate it if anyone who has a CP/M 2.2 system running 
on an 8080/8085 processer would run the exerciser and let me know the 
reported values along with a description of the 8080/8085 CPU used. I 
can then add the expected CRC values to an updated version of the 
exerciser, allowing emulator writers to have a simple to use test for 
the accuracy of their emulation.</p>
			<div id="info">The complete set of tests will take approximately 3 
hours 20 minutes to run on a 2MHz 8080.  However, this figure can be 
reduced to approximately 30 minutes by removing the 8 bit alu tests - 
albeit with a reduction in the coverage of the program.  If you would 
prefer to run the shorter test suite then please contact me and I will 
send you a copy of the modified code; I will still be happy to get any 
results.</div>
			<h2>Basic Exerciser Files</h2>
			<p>All files are provided in three different formats</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
				<li>mac - source code for the Microsoft M80 assembler.</li>
				<li>com - the source assembled into a CP/M com file.</li>
				<li>hex - the source assembled into a CP/M (Intel format) hex file.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>
					These files contain a modified version, for the 8080/8085, of Frank
 Cringles original preliminary test file.  The purpose of this 
additional test, to be run before the main exerciser (both 8080 and 8085
 versions), is just to test that the emulator is performing basic 
operations correctly (jmp, call, mvi etc).

			<p>Grateful thanks to those listed above for providing results and advice.</p>
			<p>The download links in the above table lead to copies of the 
original exerciser files that have had the appropriate CRC values 
inserted in them.  When you run the exerciser it will then report "OK" 
for tests that result in the correct CRC value.  It makes it a lot 
easier to spot any errors!</p>

			<h2>More Results Needed</h2>
			<p>Results for other CPU hardware versions are still needed, so if 
you have a system with an 8080 or 8085 CPU the please consider running 
the basic emulator and forwarding the results to me; it really would be 
appreciated.  Apart from the help it would provide to emulator writers 
it would be nice, even at this late stage, to document some of the 
differences between the various implementations of the 8080 and 8085 
CPUs.</p>
